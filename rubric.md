# Project Feedback + Evaluation

## Project Workflow

>Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program youâ€™re in (detailed above)?

**Meets/Exceeds Expectations** Nice readme, especially your Approach and Unsolved Problems sections! As projects get more complex, you'll want to be sure to include more detailed installation instructions for someone who wants to install a local version of your full stacks. For a browser-only app like this, though, you're good to go.

## Technical Requirements

>Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

**Meets Expectations** This is a clean, full-featured game with nice UI (love the big color circle!). Deployed successfully. I'd love you see you implement the features mentioned in your readme. Well done!

## Code Quality

>Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class?

**Meets Expectations** Great comments, formatting, and semantic naming. It's really quite DRY as it is! A couple of spacing issues, but well done!


## Problem Solving

>Are you able to defend why you implemented your solution in a certain way? Can you demonstrate that you thought through alternative implementations?

**Meets Expectations** Really nice work, Alice! Your solution shows a real attention to detail and precision. I enjoyed playing it :+1:
